This is mini exercise 2. For this exercise I made a smiley, which has a few glitches. One of the glitches is that the colours change in the nose and eyes when the mouse is moved. The other two glitches, are the right eye and the right side of the mouth. They have been misplaced compared to the rest of the face. 

My coding process started out with me being a bit confused aobut the assignment. Then it made me think about, what errors, glitches and noises are to me. I ended up focusing on glitches. To me glitches are faults in the look of the browser and whats in it. Then I started generating ideas of what I wanted my program to be/contain. After that I started playing around with the Brackets and searched for the desired shapes in p5.js references. The end result is visible in the HTML file attached to the mini_ex(2) foulder.  

To me a program is a set of operations for a computer to perform. Its a number of instructions, that the computer follows. Often they have some sort of interactivity coded into them. The first thing I often think about when I hear the word program, is an HTML file, a web browser that has been coded to look a certain way. 

I see an error, as a problem that arises in the computers system, either in the hardware or software, which makes it non-functionable.
