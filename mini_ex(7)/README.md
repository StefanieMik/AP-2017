As you can see, my index is blank. I tried starting out with Winnies sketch of the cars moving on an image of a road. My idea was to create an animal race track, where the user started out with choosing an animal they wanted to bet on and then for the program to change background to a race track, where small figures (supposed to be animals) run in ellipses on the track. It was supposed to be random, which one came first so that it would not be the same animal winning every time. 
I started out by making Winnies code as insporation to the race track part. I found a background picture of a race track on Google that I wanted to use. When I wrote "car" in my code as in Winnies, everything worked and the new background popped up. Then I changed all the places it said "car" in the code to "animal" and changed the name of the button from "add" to "bet", just to see if it would work. But that is when the program went blank. I have tried everything that comes to mind and right now, the only errror the console registers is a "}" in line 62, which as far as I can see is placed correctly. Every time I tried changing something in the code, the previous erros disapeard but other wierd ones appeared... 

I thought it would be a fun design, but after spending a great amount of time trying all sorts of codes, I have had to upload a blank program. 

I hope someone can maybe help me with the error and knows whats wrong with it.
