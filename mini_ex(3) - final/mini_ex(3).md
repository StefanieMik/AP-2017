My throbber pictures a clock moving quickly. The text "wait a minute" is written just above the clock. I spent a long timme trying to make the clock hands move synchronously the way they do in real-life, but I just couldn't get them to do it. Therefore, the hour and minute hands move faster than the second hand. 
The fact that the clock moves as fast as it does, is an effect made on purpose. When loading something on a computer, it often happens very quickly and the speed is what the fast-moving hands are supposed to symbolize.
