rule 1: All the shapes expand at a certain speed

Rule 2: When the shapes reach a certain size on the canvas, they start getting smaller.

Rule 3: Every shape has their own color. 

Working with this program, I got a full understanding of what he means in the article when saying, that the artist/programmer cedes the control of his art/program. Every time i typed in some new code or changed an extisting code, something different and unexpected happened. The outcome was a total suprise, but in the end I accepted the loss of control and just played around with it.
